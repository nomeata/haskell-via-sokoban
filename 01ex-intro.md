✍️ Exercises {.exercises}
=========

When solving the exercises, strive to create not just code that works,
but code that is stylish and concise. Try to write small functions which perform
just a single task, and then combine those smaller pieces to create more
complex functions. Don’t repeat yourself: write one function for each
logical task, and reuse functions as necessary.

In these exercises, you will be creating lots of drawing
and animations. The exercises will describe what you have to do, and
maybe give an (simple) example, but you are always welcome to make it
prettier and more shiny.

Traffic lights
--------------

In the class, we defined a traffic light animation. Real traffic lights have
an amber light in the middle.

Change the code to include the yellow light, and animate a correct sequence
of traffic light signaling:

 * a long green phase
 * a short amber phase
 * a long red phase
 * a short red and amber phase[^1]
 * back to green

Yon can start with [the traffic light code from above](EDIT(code/trafficController.hs)), and the result could look like this:

RUN(code/trafficController-solution.hs)


[^1]:
 I know that traffic lights in the US do not have this phase, but it is the
 correct sequence for most of Germany, and it works better for the homework.

Blooming trees
--------------

In the class, we defined a tree, but it looks a bit dire. Here is [the code again](EDIT(code/tree.hs)):

```haskell
tree :: Integer -> Picture
tree 0 = blank
tree n = polyline [(0,0),(0,1)] & translated 0 1 (
  rotated (pi/10) (tree (n-1)) & rotated (- pi/10) (tree (n-1)))
```

Make the tree bloom! Create an animation that looks like the dire `tree
8` initially, and then grows blossoms at the end of each twig within 10
seconds. After 10 seconds, the tree should be in full bloom and the
animation should stop.

A bloom could be a yellow circle growing in size, or something more
intricate with petals and better colors and whatnot.

In your code, modify `tree` to be *abstract* in the actual shape of the
blossoms. This way, the `tree` function itself is independent of time.
Do *not* pass the time parameter to the `tree` function!

The result could look like this:

RUN(code/tree-bloom.hs)

Sokoban tiles
-------------

Until the end of the tutorial, you will implement a game of Sokoban. The
rules are simple (quoted from <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban>,
which also contains a nice animation that you can look at):

> The game is played on a board of squares, where each square is a floor
> or a wall. Some floor squares contain boxes, and some floor squares
> are marked as storage locations.
>
> The player is confined to the board, and may move horizontally or
> vertically onto empty squares (never through walls or boxes). The
> player can also move into a box, which pushes it into the square
> beyond. Boxes may not be pushed into other boxes or walls, and they
> cannot be pulled. The puzzle is solved when all boxes are at storage
> locations.

We do some preparations this week. In particular, we need the different
squares that may occur:

1.  Walls

2.  Ground, i.e. empty spaces

3.  Ground marked as storage

4.  Boxes

After this exercise, we will have the necessary code to draw a sokoban
level. You can use [this code](EDIT(code/sokoban-ex1.hs)) to get started.

-   Create a functions `wall`, `ground`, `storage` and `box` of type
    `Picture`, which draw the corresponding thing, with a width and
    height of 1 and positioned at the center of the picture.

    The example picture below is very much on the dull side. Make it prettier!
    You can search for screenshots of the real game for inspiration.

-   Create a function `drawTile :: Integer -> Picture` that draws a
    tile according to the given number[^2], according to the above list.
    If the argument is not one of these four numbers, it should not draw
    anything (but should also not crash).

-   A maze can be represented as a function with the type\
    `Integer -> Integer -> Integer`, which, given two coordinates,
    returns the kind of tile to be present there.

    For now, we have one such maze, with the creative name `maze`:

    ```haskell
    maze :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer
    maze x y
      | abs x > 4  || abs y > 4  = 0
      | abs x == 4 || abs y == 4 = 1
      | x ==  2 && y <= 0        = 1
      | x ==  3 && y <= 0        = 3
      | x >= -2 && y == 0        = 4
      | otherwise                = 2
    ```

    Define a picture

    ```haskell
    pictureOfMaze :: Picture
    ```

    which will, for every coordinate $(x,y)$ with
    $x,y\in -10,\ldots,10$, uses the `maze` above to determine what tile
    to place there, uses `drawTile` to draw that tile, translated into
    the right spot.

    Of course, do not hard-code 441 invocations of `drawTile` into your
    program! Instead, use recursion to traverse the positions in
    the grid. You will likely need one recursive function to draw one row after
    another, which in turn calls a second recursive function, which then draw
    each element in that row.

-   Define `main` to be drawing of `pictureOfMaze`.

The result could look like this:

RUN(code/sokoban-ex1-sol.hs)

[^2]: Using numbers here is not good style, and we will fix that next
    week.
