Polymorphism
============

Now, we will explore how polymorphism allows for yet more abstract and
compositional thinking, and how to apply wholemeal programming.

Polymorphism is a property of a function that it can work with any type. We have seen this in the type signature of `activityOf`:
```haskell
activityOf :: world ->
              (Event -> world -> world) ->
              (world -> Picture) ->
              IO ()
```

This function is polymorphic because the type `world` is arbitrary, and can be
chosen by the caller. We did that in last week’s class when we instantiated
with `Coord`, and you did it again in the homework, using your custom `State`
type.

Parametricity
-------------

It is important to keep in mind that *the caller picks the type*. Therefore,
the implementation has to be able to handle any possible type. And since in
Haskell you cannot make decisions based on the type of an argument (only on the
value of the argument), this implies that Haskell is **parametric**:
Polymorphic code behaves “the same” for any type that you pass it to.

Why is parametricity important?

1.  It makes **type erasure** possible. Type erasure means that no information about the
    type of values is present at run-time. The compiler erases the types from your
    program as it compiles it to machine code. The benefit is that he code runs
    much faster than, say, Python code, where type information needs to be
    carried around and inspected at run-time.

2.  It restricts what polymorphic functions can do. Consider the following type signature:
    ```haskell
    riddle :: a -> a
    ```
    We do not see its implementation. What can we say about it?

    It will have to return a value of type `a`, in a way that works for every
    possible type. So it cannot return `3`, it cannot return `True`. The only
    value of type `a` that it has access to is its parameter. So the only
    sensible definition of this function is
    ```haskell
    riddle :: a -> a
    riddle x = x
    ```

    Similarly, consider a function

    ```haskell
    riddle2 :: (a -> a) -> a -> a
    ```
    which takes two arguments: a function, and a value, again of some type that
    `riddle2` cannot know anything about. We can again wonder: What values of
    type `a` can `riddle2` return? Well, it can return its second argument. Or
    it can apply its  first argument (the function) to the second argument. Or
    it can apply it twice... so there are many possible `riddle2`
    implementations, but we still can tell a lot about them from the type signature:

    ```haskell
    riddle2 :: (a -> a) -> a -> a
    riddle2 f x = x
    riddle2 f x = f x
    riddle2 f x = f (f x)
    …
    ```

    Try yourself: What can you know about a function with this type:
    ```haskell
    riddle3 :: a -> a -> a
    …
    ```

    What about this riddle:
    ```haskell
    riddle4 :: a -> b
    ```
    Such a function cannot be written in Haskell! `riddle4` has no way of
    producing a value that will work as any possible type `b`!

    If you want to learn more about what one can find out about a function from
    its polymorphic type, read up on *free theorems*.

The above is not completely accurate. It is possible to implement a function of type `riddle4`:
```haskell
riddle4 :: a -> b
riddle4 x = riddle4 x
```
But this function will send the program into a infinite loop. The above observations are true for *total* functions, i.e. functions that always return. Haskell does allow for partial functions (i.e. functions that go into an infinite loop, or that throw an exception).


Polymorphic Data Types
----------------------

Not only functions can be polymorphic, but also data types. Let us motivate
that by an example.

In last week's homework ([example solution](EDIT(code/ho-ex-3.hs))), we created a variant of `activityOf` that would
allow the game to be reset (and it was indeed polymorphic). Let us do something similar and create a variant of `activityOf` that would initially show a startup-screen, and start the game proper only when the space key is pressed.

We define a very simple start screen:

```haskell
startScreen :: Picture
startScreen = scaled 3 3 (lettering "Sokoban!")
```

In order to implement this functionality, we need, in the state, remember whether we are showing the start screen, or whether we are already playing the game. But the type of `startScreenActivityOf` (which is the same as `activityOf`) needs to be polymorphic in the state! We do not know what kind of state is used for the interaction we are wrapping, so we cannot use it to find out whether we are showing the start screen or not!

So we need to define our own state data type. And clearly, it is in one of two states: It is either showing the start screen, or the game is running, in which case we need to hold the game’s state. We can define a data type that does that:

```haskell
data SSState = StartScreen | Running world
```

With this code, we get the error message `Not in scope: type variable ‘world’`. To fix this, we have to give the type `SSState` a *type parameter*:

```haskell
data SSState world = StartScreen | Running world
```

So while `SSState` on its own is not a proper type yet, `SSState` applied to any type (e.g. `SSState Coord`) is.

Now we can implement the bits required for `startScreenActivityOf:

```haskell
startScreenActivityOf ::
    world ->
    (Event -> world -> world) ->
    (world -> Picture) ->
    IO ()
startScreenActivityOf state0 handle draw
  = activityOf state0' handle' draw'
  where
    state0' = StartScreen

    handle' (KeyPress key) StartScreen
         | key == " "                  = Running state0
    handle' _              StartScreen = StartScreen
    handle' e              (Running s) = Running (handle e s)

    draw' StartScreen = startScreen
    draw' (Running s) = draw s
```
It was easy to write down the code, because we can program in a type-driven manner: With
the type of the local functions in mind, we could simply program by cases.
Every case on its own is rather obvious, and once we handled all the cases, we
have a working program.
([Open on CodeWorld](EDIT(code/03-start-screen.hs)))

RUN(code/03-start-screen.hs)

Wholemeal interactions
----------------------

We now have this nice start screen, so it is a bit unfortunate that once we
start the game, we cannot go back and see it again. So we really would want to
combine this functionality with the reset functionality that we did in last
week's homework. But we can't! Both these generic interaction-modifiers produce
complete programs, there is no way to apply one to the other.

Surely, we can do better.

Imagine we had a type `Activity` that captures everything about an
activity. What if we then also had functions
```haskell
resetable :: Activity -> Activity
withStartScreen :: Activity -> Activity
```
that modify interactions? Then we can obviously compose them. We would also need a type
```haskell
runActivity :: Activity -> IO ()
```
that actually runs this interaction.

It is possible to define such a type `Activity`. Can you imagine how?

An interaction is defined by a state type, and by the three parameters that we so far have passed to `activityOf`. So let us not pass them to `activityOf`, but rather store them in a datatype:

```haskell
data Activity world = Activity
        world
	(Event -> world -> world)
	(world -> Picture)
```
Because of the type variable `world`, the type signatures of `resetable` and `withStartScreen` are a bit more complicated. We can use type inference to let the compiler figure it out for us, though.

Changing the existing functions `startScreenActivityOf` to `withStartScreen`, and `resetableActivityOf` to `resetable` turns out to be trivial: Just replace the three parameters by one, pattern matching on `Activity`, and replace the use of `activityOf` with the constructor `Activity`:

```haskell
resetable :: Activity s -> Activity s
resetable (Activity state0 handle draw)
  = Activity state0 handle' draw
  where handle' (KeyPress key) _ | key == "Esc" = state0
        handle' e s = handle e s

withStartScreen :: Activity s -> Activity (SSState s)
withStartScreen (Activity state0 handle draw)
  = Activity state0' handle' draw'
  where
    state0' = StartScreen

    handle' (KeyPress key) StartScreen
         | key == " "                  = Running state0
    handle' _              StartScreen = StartScreen
    handle' e              (Running s) = Running (handle e s)

    draw' StartScreen = startScreen
    draw' (Running s) = draw s
```

The function `runActivity` is also very simply to write: We just pattern
match on `Activity` to get our hands on the individual functions, and pass them to `activityOf`:

```haskell
runActivity :: Activity s -> IO ()
runActivity (Activity state0 handle draw)
  = activityOf state0 handle draw
```

The final bit we need to change, before we can put everything together, is to
actually have an `Activity` that represents the basic Sokoban game:
```haskell
sokoban :: Activity State
sokoban = Activity initialState handleEvent2 drawState2
```

And finally, we can compose our interactions ([open on CodeWorld](EDIT(code/03-activity-datatype.hs))). Try to start the game with space, and reset it with the escape key again!
```haskell
main = runActivity (resetable (withStartScreen sokoban))
```

RUN(code/03-activity-datatype.hs)

Think about what happens if we switch the order of `resetable` and `withStartScreen`!

Recursive data types
====================

An important concept that you will need in more complex programs (such as a
proper Sokoban implementation) is recursive datatypes. These can be used to
implement lists and trees and many other data structures.

In our game, the boxes will have to be moved around. It is likely that we
will want to manage a list of coordinates of these boxes, and clearly, this
is going to be part of our state.

Our code should work with any number of boxes (as various levels have various
number of boxes). Which type is suitable to store any number of coordinates? Or
-- as you would expect after we talked about polymorphism -- any number of
values of some arbitrary type?

## Lists

Of course, the standard library comes with a suitable data type, but let us,
for the sake of learning, define it ourselves. Just like we used recursion in
functions to replace loops, we can use recursion in types to implement lists:

```haskell
data List a = Empty | Entry a (List a)
```

So a value of type `List a` is either the constructor `Empty`, or there is a
list entry, which is a value of type `a`, and then the remainder of the list,
i.e. another value of type `List a`.

We can define a value of that type, by using the constructors, as you would expect:
```haskell
someBoxCoords :: List Coord
someBoxCoords = Entry (C 2 2) (Entry (C 3 3) (Entry (C (-1) 0) Empty))
```

Similarly, we can look at the elements of a list by pattern matching:
```haskell
firstBox :: List Coord -> Picture
firstBox Empty = blank
firstBox (Entry c _) = atCoord c (drawTile Box)

main :: IO ()
main = drawingOf (firstBox someBoxCoords)
```
Now, what if we want to draw all boxes in the list? We would also start by
pattern-matching on the list, handle the empty case, and handle one entry, and
then recurse on the remaining list ([open on CodeWorld](EDIT(code/03-first-list.hs))):
```haskell
pictureOfBoxes :: List Coord -> Picture
pictureOfBoxes Empty = blank
pictureOfBoxes (Entry c cs) = atCoord c (drawTile Box) & boxes cs

main :: IO ()
main = drawingOf (pictureOfBoxes someBoxCoords)
```

We observe that the recursion on the value level (in the function `pictureOfBoxes`)
corresponds to the recursion on the type level (in the type `List`). This is a
common idiom.


Let us make this interactive again: We want to use the arrow keys to move *all* boxes. Here is one way of doing that:
```haskell
movingBoxes :: Activity (List Coord)
movingBoxes = Activity someBoxCoords handle draw
  where
    draw = pictureOfBoxes
    handle (KeyPress key) s
        | key == "Right" = moveAllBoxes R s
        | key == "Up"    = moveAllBoxes U s
        | key == "Left"  = moveAllBoxes L s
        | key == "Down"  = moveAllBoxes D s
    handle _ s      = s

moveAllBoxes :: Direction -> List Coord -> List Coord
moveAllBoxes _ Empty = Empty
moveAllBoxes d (Entry c cs) = Entry (adjacentCoord d c) (moveAllBoxes d cs)
```

This works! But we are not satisfied. The function `moveAllBoxes` does a bit
too much for my taste: We there have the logic of *both* moving a single box
*and* traversing the list. Can we separate them? Sure we can, using higher order functions!

### mapList

We start by writing a very general apply-a-function-to-every-element-in-a-list
function:
```haskell
mapList _ Empty = Empty
mapList f (Entry c cs) = Entry (f c) (mapList f cs)
```
and then we can use it in `handle` (note how partially applying
`adjacentCoord` works out so nicely here!):
```haskell
    handle (KeyPress key) s
        | key == "Right" = mapList (adjacentCoord R) s
        | key == "Up"    = mapList (adjacentCoord U) s
        | key == "Left"  = mapList (adjacentCoord L) s
        | key == "Down"  = mapList (adjacentCoord D) s
    handle _ s      = s
```

What do you think is the type signature of `mapList`?

### combine

The function `mapList` is very useful, and you will most likely want to use it
in your code. In fact, it is generally recommended to use such general
higher-order functions instead of writing out an explicit recursion.

Where can we do a similar refactoring? In the function `pictureOfBoxes`! This function
also perform two things that can be separated into smaller, more generally
useful parts: For every entry in the list, it creates a `Picture`, and then it
combines all these. So how about this:
```haskell
combine :: List Picture -> Picture
combine Empty = blank
combine (Entry p ps) = p & combine ps

pictureOfBoxes :: List Coord -> Picture
pictureOfBoxes cs = combine (mapList (\c -> atCoord c (drawTile Box)) cs)
```

Granted, the code did not get much smaller. But we did gain a generally useful
`combine` function. ([Open on CodeWorld](EDIT(code/03-list-fun.hs)))


Case expressions
================

Finally, a small syntactic gimmick which you might find useful when doing the
exercises.

So far, the only place where we can do pattern matching is when we define a
function. This is sufficient, but sometimes annoying, as it requires local
functions that we might want to do without.

So let us say we want to remove all boxes from the maze. We could write it like this:
```haskell
noBoxMaze :: Coord -> Tile
noBoxMaze c = noBox (maze c)
 where
   noBox :: Tile -> Tile
   noBox Box = Ground
   noBox t   = t
```
but what we would rather write is

```haskell
noBoxMaze :: Coord -> Tile
noBoxMaze c = case maze c of
   Box -> Ground
   t   -> t
```

The syntax is the keyword `case`, followed by the expression that we want to analyze (also called the scrutinee), then keyword `of`, and then, vertically aligned, any number of alternatives. The alternatives consist of a pattern, just like in a function equation, an arrow, and the expression this should evaluate to in case the pattern matches. Even guards can be used here!
